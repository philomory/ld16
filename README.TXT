#  The Legend of Purple Dot
###      Episode 1:
##  Purple Dot the Explorer


## Story
You're a purple dot, on a new planet that you need to explore! You've got fuel,
so you're probably some kind of robot, but you're a simple purple dot so you
don't spend too much time worrying about that sort of thing. What you do know
is, you've been given a mission: Explore the planet!

## Gameplay
In the beginning, you can only see a little bit of the planet in the area
immediately surrounding you. Move around to map out more areas of the surface.
As you explore more of the surface, you'll get points. You can spend your hard
earned points on upgrades (for your body? your vehicle?). But keep an eye on your 
fuel level -- if you run out, you won't be able to explore any more! All is not 
lost, however; if you open the menu you can purchase new fuel (solar power? food?
who know? who cares? you're a purple dot!). 

Keep in mind that there's more to the world than an be seen on one screen. Walking
off the edge is safe, I promise! You'll just go to a new region; you can always come
back, really.
