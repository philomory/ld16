#  The Legend of Purple Dot
###      Episode 1:
##  Purple Dot the Explorer


## Story
You're a purple dot, on a new planet that you need to explore! You've got fuel,
so you're probably some kind of robot, but you're a simple purple dot so you
don't spend too much time worrying about that sort of thing. What you do know
is, you've been given a mission: Explore the planet!

## Gameplay
In the beginning, you can only see a little bit of the planet in the area
immediately surrounding you. Move around to map out more areas of the surface.
As you travel, keep an eye on your fuel level -- if you run out, you won't be
able to explore any more! All is not lost, however; if you sit still and wait,
you'll slowly restore fuel (solar power? food? who know? who cares? you're a
purple dot!). As you explore more of the surface, you'll get points.

Also of note: Purple dots cannot swim.
